### Installation
 ```shell
 npm install -g meread
 ```

<br>
### Usage
```shell
meread
```

<br>
### Motivation
Engineers are famous for being entirely focused on the hack. From the technical implementation to pounding out the code, README files are often forgotten. When others want to see and learn from your code they head to your README file. Without loving, it is probably a mess.

Use ```meread``` to make quick and clean readme files. Have a designer build the template or just stick to the prebuilt template we provide in order to get your information out to an audience in a presentable way!
